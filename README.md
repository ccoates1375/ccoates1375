<h1>Welcome To My Github Profile!</h1>

<p>
Currently, I am exploring the exciting fields of AI and Blockchain, while also studying for the ISTQB Software Testing Certification. As a member of the Upsilon Pi Epsilon Honor Society and the Information Security Club, as well as one of the founding members of the Software Engineering Club, I am always looking for opportunities to collaborate with others on new and exciting projects.
</p>

<h2>Education</h2>
<p>
Recently, I completed a Stanford Online Relational Databases and SQL certificate course through EdX.org. I also have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and a minor in Web Development.
</p>

<h2>Creative Side</h2>
<p>
In addition to my technical skills, I have creative vision and always looking for ways to express myself through coding and music. If you're interested, check out my other website <a href="https://ProvBeats.com" rel="author">ProvBeats.com</a>, which I created with WiX. I am also looking for feedback on it and am prepared to rewrite it from scratch, so any help is appreciated. I also built a high-performing website for international jazz saxophonist <a href="https://gregabate.com" rel="author">GregAbate.com</a>.
</p>

<h2>Portfolio</h2>
<p>
I am a technology enthusiast with a passion for learning and growing my skills in the fields of AI and blockchain. As a software testing, web design and development enthusiast, I am seeking opportunities to put my knowledge into practice. If you're hiring, check out my portfolio website <a href="https://chriscoates.dev" rel="author">ChrisCoates.dev</a>, which I built from scratch using HTML & CSS. Looking forward to joining a great team!
