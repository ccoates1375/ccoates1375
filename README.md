<h2>Creative Side</h2>
<p>
In addition to my technical skills, I have creative vision and always looking for ways to express myself through coding and music. If you're interested, check out my other website <a href="https://ProvBeats.com" rel="author">ProvBeats.com</a>, which I created with WiX. I am also looking for feedback on it and am prepared to rewrite it from scratch, so any help is appreciated. I also built a high-performing website for international jazz saxophonist <a href="https://gregabate.com" rel="author">GregAbate.com</a>.

As a technology enthusiast, I have a strong drive to continually learn and develop my skills. My areas of interest include software testing, web design, and development, with a particular focus on AI and blockchain. I am actively seeking opportunities to apply my knowledge and expertise in these fields. If you are hiring, please take a moment to explore my portfolio website, ChrisCoates.dev, which I created using HTML and CSS.
