Welcome to my Github Profile!

I'm @ccoates1375, a recent graduate from Rhode Island College with a B.A. in Computer Science and a minor in Web Development. Member of Upsilon Pi Epsilon Honor Society, Information Security Club and a founding member of Software Engineering Club. Completed a Stanford Online Relational Databases and SQL certificate course through EdX.org. I have a passion for technology and eager to continue growing my skills in the craft. Currently exploring the fields of AI and Blockchain as well as studying for ISTQB Software Testing Certification. 

In addition to my technical skills, I also have a creative side and am always looking for opportunities to collaborate on projects. If you're interested, help me out by giving feedback on my other website https://ProvBeats.com. I created it with WiX but I'm prepared to rewrite it from scratch and would love the help of others in the process. I also built a high performing website for international jazz saxophonist https://GregAbate.com

As a software testing and web design & development enthusiast, I am seeking opportunities to put my knowledge into practice. If you're hiring, check out my portfolio website I built from scratch using HTML & CSS.

Let's work together and make some amazing things happen!
